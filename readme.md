# Custom CSS Per Domain

**Also tired of ugly websites? Me too—let's fix them!**  
With *Custom CSS Per Domain*, you can easily inject personalized styles into any site you visit. No more cluttered layouts, tiny fonts, or glaring color schemes—take control and make the web work for *you*.

## How It Works

1. **Install the Extension**: Load it in Chrome via `chrome://extensions` (Developer mode).
2. **Open the Popup**: Click on the extension icon to reveal the simple interface.
3. **Add Your Own CSS**:  
   - In the *Domain* field, either type the domain (e.g., `www.example.com`) or accept the default (which auto-populates from your current tab).  
   - In the *CSS* field, paste or type your custom rules (e.g., `body { background: #fafafa !important; }`).  
4. **Save**: Hit the **“Save / Update”** button, and voilà—your new styles are instantly applied whenever you visit that domain.
